# Sample Lab Test 2

## Question 1

1. **Question Description**:

    The greatest common divisor (GCD) for any two positive integers (a, b) is the greatest factor which is common to both the integers a and b.<br>
    Write a Python program that reads two positive integers and finds their (GCD).

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter the first positive integer: **12**<br>
    Enter the second positive integer: **18**<br>
    The GCD of 12 and 18 is 6

    ---
    Enter the first positive integer: **13**<br>
    Enter the second positive integer: **8**<br>
    The GCD of 13 and 8 is 1
