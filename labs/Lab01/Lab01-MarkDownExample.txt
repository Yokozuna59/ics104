# Cell Types
- Code Cells
    - Contents in this cell are treated as statements in a programming language of the current kernel, in our case Python 3. 
    - When such cell is run, its result is displayed in an output cell. 
    - The output may be text, image, matplotlib plots or HTML tables.
- Markdown Cells
    - These cells contain text formatted using markdown language. 
    - All kinds of formatting features are available like 
        - making text bold (putting words between two \*\*)
        - making text italic (putting words between two \*)
        - displaying a heading (starting the line with a \#)
        - displaying a subheading (starting the line with a \#\#)
        - displaying a subsubheading (starting the line with a \#\#\#)
        - displaying unordered list (starting the line with a hyphen \-)
        - ... etc.
    - Markdown cells are especially useful to provide documentation to the computational process of the notebook.

- Raw Cells
    - Contents in raw cells are not evaluated by notebook kernel, that is why it is better to use Markdown.
