# This program calculate the area and circumference.
#

# Defining the constant PI
PI = 3.14159

# Setting the value of the radius
radius = 10

# Write your code below this line
area = PI * radius * radius # Calculate the area in unit square
circumference = 2 * PI * radius # Calculate the circumference in unit
print("The area is", area, "units square and circumference is", circumference, "units, of a 10 units radius.")
