# Lab 03

## Exercise 1

Write an interactive Python3 program that prompts for and reads an integer number between 1,100 and 999,999. It then prints the number with a comma separating the thousand.
Hint: use % and // division.  Also assume that the number formed by the last 3 digits is >= 100

Sample program runs:

Please enter a number between 1,100 and 999,999:  1234

1,234

---

Please enter a number between 1,100 and 999,999:  45786

45,786

---

Please enter a number between 1,100 and 999,999: 999999

999,999

## Exercise 2

A student password is formed as follows:

- Student’s first name in lowercase.
- Followed by last character in uppercase
- Followed by first character in uppercase
- Followed by $ character
- Followed by student’s year of birth * 2

Write an interactive Paython3 program that prompts and reads a student’s first name and year of birth. It then creates and prints the student password.

Sample program runs:

Enter student's first name: MUHSIN

Enter student's year of birth: 1982

Password = muhsinNM$3964

---

Enter student's first name: Saleem

Enter student's year of birth: 2005

Password = saleemMS$4010

## Exercise 3

Write an interactive Python3 program that prompts for a measurement in kilometers. It then converts it to miles, feet, and inches.

Note:
$$1 mi = 1.609344 km$$
$$1 mi = 5280 feet$$
$$1 ft = 12 in$$

Sample program runs:

Enter distance in kilometers: 626.5

626.50 kilometers equals 389 miles, 1526 feet and 2.33 inches

---

Enter distance in kilometers: 8.0

8.00 kilometers equals 4 miles, 5126 feet and 8.63 inches

---

Enter distance in kilometers: 1.2

1.20 kilometers equals 0 miles, 3937 feet and 0.09 inches
