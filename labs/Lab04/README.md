# Lab 04

## Exercise 1

Write a program that reads in three integers and prints "in order" if they are sorted in ascending or descending order, or "not in order" otherwise.

For example:

1 2 5 in order

1 5 2 not in order

5 2 1 in order

1 2 2 in order

## Exercise 2

Write a program that translates a letter grade into a number grade. Letter grades are A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D+, D, and F. Their numeric values are 4, 3.75, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.

For example:

Enter a letter grade: B

The numeric value is 3.0

---

Enter a letter grade: X

Invalid letter grade
