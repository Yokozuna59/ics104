## Exercise 1

1. **Question Discription:**

    Write a program that reads in three integers and prints "in order" if they are sorted in ascending or descending order, or "not in order" otherwise.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter first number: **1**
    Enter second number: **2**
    Enter third number: **5**
    1 2 5 in order

    ---
    Enter first number: **1**
    Enter second number: **5**
    Enter third number: **2**
    1 2 5 not in order

    ---
    Enter first number: **5**
    Enter second number: **2**
    Enter third number: **1**
    1 2 5 in order

    ---
    Enter first number: **1**
    Enter second number: **2**
    Enter third number: **2**
    1 2 2 in order

## Exercise 2

1. **Question Discription:**

    Write a program that translates a letter grade into a number grade. Letter grades are A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D+, D, and F. Their numeric values are 4, 3.75, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, and 0.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter a letter grade: **B**
    The numeric value is 3.0

    ---
    Enter a letter grade: **X**
    Invalid letter grade
