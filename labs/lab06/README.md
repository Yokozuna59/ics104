# Lab 06

## Exercise 1

1. **Question Description**:

    Write a program that reads an integer value and prints all of its binary digits in reverse order: Print the remainder (number % 2), then replace the number with number // 2. Keep going until the number is 0.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter an integer: **13**<br>
    The binary digits in reverse order are 1011

    ---
    Enter an integer: **38**<br>
    The binary digits in reverse order are 011001

## Exercise 2

1. **Description**:

    Write a loop that reads positive numbers from the user and sum them. The loop continues till a negative number is entered. Your program then prints the result. If the user enter a negative value from the beginning, your code should display: 'No positive number was entered'. You should include the empty string in your loop without any error (i.e. read the first sample run).

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter a positive number (or a negative value to finish):**5**<br>
    Enter a positive number (or a negative value to finish):**2**<br>
    Enter a positive number (or a negative value to finish):<br>
    Enter a positive number (or a negative value to finish):**4**<br>
    Enter a positive number (or a negative value to finish):**-5**<br>
    Sum = 11.0

    ---
    Enter a positive number (or a negative value to finish):**-8**<br>
    No positive number was entered.

## Exercise 3

1. **Description**:

    Using for loop, write a python program that reads an integer from the user and prints back the number of the digits in that integer and the sum of them. For example, if the input was 2308 , the output would be: Your integer has 4 digits and their sum is 13.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter a positive integer value: **2308**<br>
    Your integer has 4 digits and their sum is 13

    ---
    Enter a positive integer value: **714702**<br>
    Your integer has 6 digits and their sum is 21
