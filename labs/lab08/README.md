## Exercise 3

1. **Question Description**:

    Write a program that asks for a password, then asks again to confirm it. If the passwords donâ€™t match or the rules are not fulfilled, prompt again. Your program should include a function that checks whether a password is valid.

    Secure password rules:

      - The password must be at least 8 characters long.
      - The password must have at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.
      - The password must have at least one digit.

2. **Sample Runs** (user input is in bold):

    Enter a secure password: **TheBest#1**<br>
